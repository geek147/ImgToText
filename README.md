# ImgToText

In this project, i try to capture text from image. After text captured, i'll get current location
latitude and longitude and try to calculate distance and estimated time from current location to
specific location. After distance and estimated time retrieved, data for text captured, distance and
estimated time send it to firebase and the app will show next screen with data of text captured,
distance and estimated time


Library and Tools that i use in this project:
1. Text Recognition from Google
2. Distance Matrix API for calculate estimated time and distance
3. Firebase Realtime Database
4. Okhttp for getting data from API
